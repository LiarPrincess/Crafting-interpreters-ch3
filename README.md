Implementation of VM presented in the 3rd chapter of wonderful [Crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html) by Bob Nystrom ([@munificentbob](https://twitter.com/munificentbob)).

Please note that the VM is not finished, because I decided to work on [Violet (Python VM written in Swift)](https://github.com/LiarPrincess/Violet) instead.
